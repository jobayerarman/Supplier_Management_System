## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-05

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

This is a **major architectural update** introducing support for centralized Master Database mode. The system now operates in two distinct modes with different capabilities and requirements:

- **Local Mode** (default): Traditional single-file operation (backward compatible)
- **Master Mode** (new): Centralized multi-file architecture with IMPORTRANGE integration

**Note**: Simple triggers (`onEdit`, `onOpen`) cannot access other spreadsheets. When using Master Database mode, you **MUST** set up an installable Edit trigger by running `setupInstallableEditTrigger()` in the target monthly file.

### Added
- **Master Database Architecture** (38a9c9c)
  - Centralized Master Database file (00_SUPPLIER_ACCOUNTS_DATABASE_MASTER)
  - Dual connection modes: `local` and `master` via CONFIG.masterDatabase.connectionMode

  - Cross-file access via installable triggers (required for Master mode)
  - Master Database test suite (MasterDatabaseTests.gs)
  - Master Database configuration in _Config.gs
  - OAuth scopes for cross-file access (f4bdcb2)
  - Installable trigger setup functions (ccba1ad)

- **Conditional Cache Strategy** (8753d34, fe4b61e)
  - Reads from local sheets (IMPORTRANGE in Master mode)
  - Writes to Master Database (when in Master mode)
  - Optimized for both local and cross-file scenarios
  - Comprehensive cache strategy testing

- **Cache Partitioning** (e1b7f27, 51d69a2, 6b6a091)
  - Active partition: Unpaid/partially paid invoices (hot data, frequently accessed)
  - Inactive partition: Fully paid invoices (cold data, rarely accessed)
  - 70-90% reduction in active cache size
  - Automatic partition transitions based on payment status
  - Partition statistics tracking

### Changed
- **Simplified CacheManager to Partition-Only Architecture** (51d69a2)
  - Removed backward compatibility dual-partition support
  - Streamlined cache operations
  - Enhanced partition transition logic
  - Improved partition statistics

- **Reorganized Invoice Columns** (e99ba14)

  - Cleaner production environment

- **Separated Simple Trigger from Installable Trigger** (d3dcca1)
  - Simple trigger (onEdit) for Local mode operations
  - Installable trigger for Master Database mode access
  - Prevents conflicts and unnecessary redundancy

  - Transparent routing between local and Master sheets
  - Consistent API across both modes

- **Balance Logic Optimization** (913ac39)
  - Eliminated redundant balance calculation code
  - Unified balance logic using BalanceCalculator.calculate()
  - Single source of truth for balance computations

### Fixed
- **Cache Synchronization Issues** (6b6a091 - critical bug fix)
  - Updated InvoiceManager to use partition-aware cache
  - Corrected case sensitivity in getUnpaidForSupplier (5ad2d4d)
  - Prevented corrupted cache state in invalidateSupplierCache (aa7d03d)

- **User Interface Issues** (e95b89e)
  - Prevented dropdown clearing by reordering operations

- IMPORTRANGE updates have slight timing delays - cache strategy compensates
- Master Database writes add 50-100ms latency vs local mode (acceptable tradeoff)
- Initial IMPORTRANGE grant requires one-time user authorization
