# InvoiceManager Refactor - Quick Reference

## At-a-Glance Summary

**Goal**: Apply PaymentManager's proven 7-commit refactoring patterns to InvoiceManager

**Scope**: Code quality, maintainability, and organization (NOT performance optimization)

**Duration**: 2-3 days across 7 commits

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW (Phase 1 & 3) / 🟡 MEDIUM (Phase 2)

---

## 7-Commit Roadmap

### 📝 Commit 1: Extract Constants
**Content**: Create `CONSTANTS` object with all magic numbers/strings
**Lines Added**: ~30 (new object)
**Lines Removed**: ~20 (from scattered usage)
**Risk**: 🟢 LOW
**Impact**: Self-documenting code, single source of truth

**Commit Message**:
```
refactor: extract named constants in InvoiceManager

- Create CONSTANTS object for formula templates
- Create CONSTANTS for status and payment type values
- Replace magic strings throughout module
- Add balance threshold constant (0.01)

Benefits: Self-documenting, single modification point
```

---

### 📝 Commit 2: Extract Data Builders
**Content**: Extract formula building & row data construction
**Lines Added**: ~40 (new functions)
**Lines Removed**: ~30 (from duplication in create/batchCreate)
**Risk**: 🟢 LOW
**Impact**: DRY code, shared logic, easier maintenance

**New Functions**:
- `_buildInvoiceFormulas(rowNum)` - Formula string generation
- `_buildInvoiceRowData(invoice)` - Row array construction

**Commit Message**:
```
refactor: extract data building functions in InvoiceManager

- Extract _buildInvoiceFormulas() to prevent formula duplication
- Extract _buildInvoiceRowData() for consistent row structure
- Used by create() and batchCreate() functions
- Eliminates DRY violation across 2+ locations

Benefits: Single source of truth for row structure
```

---

### 📝 Commit 3: Introduce Result Builders
**Content**: Create immutable result object constructors
**Lines Added**: ~60 (new builder functions)
**Lines Modified**: ~80 (update return statements)
**Risk**: 🟡 MEDIUM (changes return types)
**Impact**: Consistent results, safer concurrency, easier testing

**New Functions**:
- `_buildCreationResult(invoiceId, row, action)` ✅ Success
- `_buildUpdateResult(row, action)` ✅ Success
- `_buildDuplicateError(invoiceNo, row)` ❌ Duplicate
- `_buildLockError(operation)` ❌ Lock failed
- `_buildValidationError(invoiceNo, reason)` ❌ Invalid
- `_buildGenericError(operation, error)` ❌ Other error

**Commit Message**:
```
refactor: introduce immutable result builders in InvoiceManager

- Create 6 result builder functions for consistency
- All builders include timestamp for debugging
- Used by all public API methods
- Guarantees complete result objects (no missing fields)

Benefits: Consistent API, no partial state, safer for tests
```

---

### 📝 Commit 4: Extract Lock HOF
**Content**: Create higher-order function for lock management
**Lines Added**: ~25 (new HOF)
**Lines Removed**: ~26 (boilerplate from create/batchCreate)
**Risk**: 🟡 MEDIUM (lock safety critical)
**Impact**: -54% boilerplate, consistent error handling

**New Function**:
- `_withLock(operation, context)` - Wraps operation with lock/unlock

**Usage**:
```javascript
return this._withLock(() => {
  // Business logic only
  return this._buildCreationResult(invoiceId, row);
}, { operationType: 'invoice creation' });
```

**Commit Message**:
```
refactor: extract lock management HOF in InvoiceManager

- Create _withLock() higher-order function
- Centralizes acquire/release/error handling
- Reduces boilerplate by 54% (13 lines → 6)
- Used by create() and batchCreate()

Benefits: Less boilerplate, guaranteed cleanup, consistent errors
```

---

### 📝 Commit 5: Reorganize into 7 Sections
**Content**: Add section headers, reorder functions
**Lines Added**: ~15 (section headers)
**Lines Removed**: 0 (reorganization only)
**Risk**: 🟢 LOW (no logic changes)
**Impact**: Dramatically improved navigability

**New Structure**:
```
SECTION 1: CONSTANTS
SECTION 2: PUBLIC API - CORE OPERATIONS
SECTION 3: PUBLIC API - QUERIES & ANALYSIS
SECTION 4: PUBLIC API - BATCH OPERATIONS
SECTION 5: INTERNAL HELPERS - DATA BUILDING
SECTION 6: INTERNAL HELPERS - UTILITIES
SECTION 7: RESULT BUILDERS
```

**Commit Message**:
```
refactor: reorganize InvoiceManager into 7-section architecture

- Add clear section headers (=== markers)
- Group related functions under sections
- Match PaymentManager organizational pattern
- Sections: Constants, Core API, Queries, Batch, Data Building, Utils, Builders

Benefits: Better navigability, clear mental model
```

---

### 📝 Commit 6: Break Down Complex Functions
**Content**: Extract pure functions from large methods
**Lines Added**: ~40 (new helper functions)
**Lines Removed**: ~60 (broken out from original functions)
**Risk**: 🟢 LOW (pure functions, no state changes)
**Impact**: Smaller functions, pseudocode-like code

**Functions to Refactor**:
- `buildUnpaidDropdown()` (135 → 80 lines)
  - Extract `_validateDropdownRequest()`
  - Extract `_buildDropdownUI()`
  - Extract `_updateDropdownCell()`

- `batchCreateInvoices()` (130+ → 100 lines)
  - Extract `_validateInvoiceDataBatch()`
  - Extract `_insertInvoiceBatch()`

- `create()` (93 → 60 lines)
  - Extract `_insertInvoiceRow()`
  - Extract `_validateNewInvoice()`

**Commit Message**:
```

- Extract _buildDropdownUI() from buildDuePaymentDropdown
- Extract _insertInvoiceRow() from createInvoice
- Extract _validateInvoiceDataBatch() from batchCreateInvoices
- Extract _insertInvoiceBatch() from batchCreateInvoices

Benefits: Smaller functions, clearer logic, easier testing
```

### 📝 Commit 7: Improve Semantic Naming
**Content**: Rename functions for clarity and consistency
**Lines Modified**: ~50 (function names and calls)
**Risk**: 🟢 LOW (backward compat wrappers provided)
**Impact**: Self-documenting API

**Naming Changes**:
- `create()` → `createInvoice()` 📌 More explicit
- `find()` → `findInvoice()` 📌 More explicit
- `updateOptimized()` → `updateInvoiceIfChanged()` 📌 Describes behavior
- `getAllForSupplier()` → `getInvoicesForSupplier()` 📌 More direct
- `getStatistics()` → `getInvoiceStatistics()` 📌 Context-specific
- `buildUnpaidDropdown()` → `buildDuePaymentDropdown()` 📌 More specific
- `batchCreate()` → `batchCreateInvoices()` 📌 More explicit
- `setFormulas()` → `applyInvoiceFormulas()` 📌 More action-oriented

**Backward Compatibility** (keep old names):
```javascript
// Deprecated, but still work
function find(supplier, invoiceNo) {
  return InvoiceManager.findInvoice(supplier, invoiceNo);
}
```

**Commit Message**:
```
refactor: improve semantic naming in InvoiceManager

- Rename functions for clarity and consistency:
  - create() → createInvoice()
  - find() → findInvoice()
  - getAllForSupplier() → getInvoicesForSupplier()
  - getStatistics() → getInvoiceStatistics()
